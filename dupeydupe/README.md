### I/O exploration 

Pretty striaghtforward program, it takes in an array of strings from the terminal and prints the _last_ string in the array that is a duplicate of another string in the array.
On top of this, for any 2 consecutive occurences of the word "Dupe" anywhere in the array, the program prints "dupe dupe!"
